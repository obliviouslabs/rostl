# rostl-datastructures

This crate provides oblivious data structures (arrays, maps, heaps, stacks, queues, vectors, sharded maps) for use in trusted execution environments (TEEs) and other privacy-preserving applications. All operations are designed to be data- and instruction-trace oblivious.

See the main project [README](https://github.com/obliviouslabs/rostl/README.md) for more details, usage, and contribution guidelines.
